Anderson acceleration (AA) is a well-known method for accelerating the convergence of iterative algorithms, with applications in various fields including deep learning and optimization. Despite its popularity in these areas, the effectiveness of AA in classical machine learning classifiers has not been thoroughly studied.
Tabular data, in particular, presents a unique challenge for deep learning models, and classical machine learning models are known to perform better in these scenarios. However, the convergence analysis of these models has received limited attention.
We implement a support vector machine (SVM) classifier variant that incorporates AA to speed up convergence. We performed experiments on our SVM with and without Anderson acceleration on several datasets from the biology domain. We demonstrated that AA significantly improves convergence and reduces training loss. We aim to inspire more studies that explore the applications of AA in classical machine learning.
